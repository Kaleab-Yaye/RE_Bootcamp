# what makes  ansroid different

so as we know it the android runs in the JVM like enviromebt but it really is not, so as we know it insise and apk there are no .class files as you woudl find in the .jar files.
what this means is the the class ClassLoader wont work instead in android we have *BaseDexClassLoader*

this is the fundamentall class loader variant in android. and all the class loader in android inherit this class, so knowing how this works is imporant.

so look at this smali defintin of it and let me trey to explain what really is going on in here

```smali
# The .super directive is the first and most important clue.
# It tells us that BaseDexClassLoader IS A ClassLoader and inherits its logic.
.class public Ldalvik/system/BaseDexClassLoader;
.super Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;

# --- KEY FIELD ---

# This is the most important field added by this class.
# It holds a special helper object that knows how to manage a list of DEX files.
.field private final pathList:Ldalvik/system/DexPathList;


# --- CONSTRUCTOR ---

# This is a common constructor for this class.
.method public constructor <init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/io/File;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V
    .locals 1
    # p1 = dexPath (the path(s) to the APK/DEX files)
    # p2 = optimizedDirectory (a writable directory for ODEX files)
    # p3 = librarySearchPath (path(s) to native .so libraries)
    # p4 = parent ClassLoader

    # First, it calls its parent's constructor, passing along the parent loader (p4).
    # This correctly sets up the parent-first delegation chain.
    invoke-direct {p0, p4}, Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;-><init>(Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V

    # -----------------------------------------------------------
    # ---> THE KEY MECHANIC: CREATING THE DexPathList <---
    # -----------------------------------------------------------
    # It creates a new instance of the DexPathList helper object.
    new-instance v0, Ldalvik/system/DexPathList;

    # It passes all the path information (p1, p3, p2) to the helper's constructor.
    invoke-direct {v0, p0, p1, p3, p2}, Ldalvik/system/DexPathList;-><init>(Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/io/File;)V

    # It stores this newly created helper object in its 'pathList' field.
    iput-object v0, p0, Ldalvik/system/BaseDexClassLoader;->pathList:Ldalvik/system/DexPathList;

    return-void
.end method


# --- KEY METHOD OVERRIDE ---

# Remember that 'findClass' was abstract in the parent?
# BaseDexClassLoader provides the concrete implementation.
.method protected findClass(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Class;
    # p1 is the name of the class to find (e.g., "com.po.MainActivity").

    # -----------------------------------------------------------
    # ---> DELEGATING TO THE DexPathList <---
    # -----------------------------------------------------------
    # It gets the DexPathList helper object from its field.
    iget-object v0, p0, Ldalvik/system/BaseDexClassLoader;->pathList:Ldalvik/system/DexPathList;
    
    # It calls the 'findClass' method on the HELPER object.
    # The helper object contains the actual logic to iterate through the DEX files
    # and search for the class definition.
    invoke-virtual {v0, p1}, Ldalvik/system/DexPathList;->findClass(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Class;
    move-result-object p1

    # Returns the result from the helper.
    return-object p1
.end method
```

1. you can see that it extendes the ClassLoader
2. there is a field `pathList` which stores an object of a helper class `DexpathList`
3. so there is constractor this constractor, takes the dexpath(our main interest, the .so library path, the legacy argument ( the io file for ODEX), and the parent ClassLoader)
4. now we instantiate the fieldds in the super which one of them will be the field to hold the parent ClassLoade( dont confuse them both they are noth the same)
5. now the already concreat implmented methode like findLoadedclass, loadclass. are there and not seen here, but you shoudl know and remmerb how the logic goes in there doesn change and must be repsectd
6. now sine the only abstact methode there was the findMethode() that is where our DexClassLoader logic seats in.
7. so now the `pathList` holds the reffernce to the object the is the `DexPathList` and we have passes the (dexPath, and its own refference) incase letter on the logic inside this class need to do somthign with the `DexclassLoader`
8. now the `.findClass("the spcific class name")` will be called and what will happen is that since the BaseDexClasLoader is free to provide concea implimentation for this, its enternal logic is to call
   .findClass("the Specific class name") on the pathList onbject that its stored. and since this pathList object has all the dexfile path, and we are passing the spciic class that we are requiring to find it will seach
   the entire dexfile and will find our class and returnes it.
9. so our main interse points are `the pathList` and the   `findClass()` on the DexPathList obect( where the real logic and alogoirtyhm of finding the class resides)


# the PathClassLoader and the DexClassLoader

## PathClassLoader
so the thing you should knwo about the base class loader is it is a simple non reveltionally clas that extends the `BaseDexClassLoader` and i will provide the smali after this.
buw if you remmebr form our the Ansestor section that we have seen we have seen that what how the pathClasssLoader is instantited and called we have seen we passes only two argument and thosare the path to the apk
adn the parent classLoader. so sinse it has to call super on the `BaseDexClass` loader we can infer that most of the time the BaseDexClassLoader is called with null (.so librayy path and with null ODEX file path)
and that is exactly what happens have a look at is.

```smali
# Again, the .super directive is the most important line.
# It is a child of BaseDexClassLoader, so it inherits everything we just learned.
.class public Ldalvik/system/PathClassLoader;
.super Ldalvik/system/BaseDexClassLoader;


# --- THE MAIN CONSTRUCTOR ---

# This is the constructor you will see used most often for this class.
.method public constructor <init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V
    .locals 2
    # p1 is the dexPath (the path(s) to the APK/DEX files).
    # p2 is the parent ClassLoader.

    # First, it calls its parent's (BaseDexClassLoader) constructor.
    # It passes along the dexPath (p1) and the parent (p2).
    # But look at the other two arguments that BaseDexClassLoader expects:
    # 'optimizedDirectory' and 'librarySearchPath'.
    const/4 v0, 0x0 # This is a null for the librarySearchPath.
    const/4 v1, 0x0 # This is a null for the optimizedDirectory.

    invoke-direct {p0, p1, v0, v1, p2}, Ldalvik/system/BaseDexClassLoader;-><init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/io/File;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V

    return-void
.end method


# --- ANOTHER CONSTRUCTOR (Less common) ---
.method public constructor <init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V
    .locals 1
    # p1 = dexPath
    # p2 = librarySearchPath
    # p3 = parent

    # This version also calls the parent constructor, but passes null
    # for the 'optimizedDirectory'.
    const/4 v0, 0x0 # This is a null for the optimizedDirectory.

    invoke-direct {p0, p1, v0, p2, p3}, Ldalvik/system/BaseDexClassLoader;-><init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/io/File;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V
    
    return-void
.end method
```
so the main things you shoudl kwno abotu this class is that
0. this is teh defuale loader meaning, if you debug a normal app and see its class loader it is of this type
1. it oprates under the understanding that it is tied to a ready only installation directoroy of the apk
2. and it doens let the creation of direcoty for optmized dex files which packers and dynamic code loader need to oprate, meaning those loader can extend this classLoader type

# DexClassLoader
So as we said, many time over when an app want to use a methode in a class adn if the class object for that class in not already in metaspace ART has teh reposiblity to load it,
so it uses the PathClassLoader("the apps path", parent_Loader). but the thing this only allwos you to loadd from the read only part of the apk. but there is anothere andorid API that is sibling to PathLoader that will
let you load cladd form dex files that are not in the orginal apps apk file but from diffent directorye.
so that si the DexClassLoader.
this also extendes, in android, the `BaseDexClassLoader`,(it has the pathList: L..../DexPathList) fields and staff. and this api look like thsi in smali.

```smali
# Once again, it is a direct child of BaseDexClassLoader.
# It inherits the exact same core logic.
.class public Ldalvik/system/DexClassLoader;
.super Ldalvik/system/BaseDexClassLoader;


# --- THE ONE AND ONLY CONSTRUCTOR ---

.method public constructor <init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V
    .locals 0
    # p1 = dexPath (the path(s) to the APK/DEX/JAR files). THIS IS THE PAYLOAD PATH.
    # p2 = optimizedDirectory (a path to a WRITABLE directory). THIS IS THE KEY DIFFERENCE.
    # p3 = librarySearchPath (path(s) to native .so libraries).
    # p4 = parent ClassLoader.

    # -----------------------------------------------------------
    # ---> THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE <---
    # -----------------------------------------------------------
    # It calls its parent's (BaseDexClassLoader) constructor.
    # It passes along the parent (p4).
    # It passes along the library path (p3).
    # It takes the 'dexPath' (p1) and passes it to the parent.
    # BUT, for the 'optimizedDirectory' parameter, it passes p2.
    # It does NOT pass null. It passes the writable directory provided by the caller.
    invoke-direct {p0, p1, p2, p3, p4}, Ldalvik/system/BaseDexClassLoader;-><init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)V

    return-void
.end method
```

look the same with the pathClassLoader. the oonly diffrence is it doenst pass null in the plase of the optiizedDirectory argument when it calles .super() as the pathclassLoader did.
