# encapsulation
encapuslation is the way of hidin hte interanl logic and implemntaion form the otside world it is the art of  not exposign how you work.
but to realise this in oop there spcially in java acces modfire are used
## acces modfiers
* public; field with this acces mofgier can be accced from any wwhere
* Prottected; class in the packege and child class can acces it
* private; only methode and fields inside the smae class can see and acces it

## syntax
the way to define a field in java is with the .field directive
 .field [acces modfiers] [othere modfiere like [const, static and so on] <name of field>: its data type
 exmpale
 ```smali
 .field private static const name:Ljava/Lang/String;
 ```
 now how do you acces and chnage those field on an object that is inslized

## accesign thos fields

### instance fields
thos field belong to the object so you can acces them wiht the iput and i get methode we have seen in 1.2 core instractions
### static fields
a static field belonges to the class as a whole meaning there will be a didacte place for this part of the object or any othere object that we inslie from this class
we use the sget and sput; commands
syntax

sget [dest registor], [object regisotr] , <class path>-><name of field>:data type # you are readin data of the static field
sput [source registor],[object regisotr] , <class path>-><name of field>:data type # you are puting value in to a static field
