# Providers
ok there is still somthigns i didn tfully get as the syntax is verbios and we will see all the xml disiction in the coming lesson but for now.
so all apps run in sandbox meaning they are isoloted for good reasons, and they only let the information they want though what is called content provider.
there two types of content providers
1. providers for the app to use only; like exmplel bankkign app that store all trasacion hisotry locally
2. provider for every one, exmple contacts provider have a provider that lets every one with permsion acces contacts.
we will se in teh futre what those quryes will look but for  now identfiend a provider is all we need;

provider look like this in the manfiest xml.

```xml
<provider android:authorities="com.calculatorx.simple.calculator.scientific.androidx-startup" android:exported="false" android:name="androidx.startup.InitializationProvider">
```
