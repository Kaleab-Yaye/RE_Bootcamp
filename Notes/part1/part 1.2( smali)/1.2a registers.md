# registors

the dalvic/ARM is registord bassed system meaning there are not actuall names for variablels and paramerters ands so on there are just registores noted by
v1,v2,v3,v0 and so on

## local registors;
those are the vairable sthat bilong to the methode; and they are denoted by v1,v1,v3.... the ART should be told explicitly which registory to use.
## Parameter registors;
those are the variables that would take the paremters in any methodes(p1,p2,p3); we will see what they look like but one of the most improatnt rules that you have to know
is that in java there is the key word that is the this.you do stuff; but in delvic the this key word is the p0; this holds the refrence to the object of the class on the hipe. 

so you migh be asking what about the field level variables; well the thing is those are not needed for fast prossing we need them to acces info but you dont usullwryy work on thme you work more of the time on vriables thart is in a loop or methodes; so for this reason to make the porcess super fast for this reason we use the registors;

## the methods frame;
now when a mthode is loaded in to a memery the system has to prepare what is called the **methode frame** this is a work shop for the mthdoe tha thas all the required registors; bur for the system to build us this powerfull work shop need to epxlitly tell what we need psicall the numeber of prameter and  locarl registors we won we the kew word
```Smali
.locals <n>
"n is the numer of registors that will be here"
```
or we can use the .registors but this would also include the locals and the parmeter regisotrs which we dont use oftelly the 
parammerters regisotry number is known by defualt bassed on the numeb of paramers you put on to the argumetn field look at this code for exmpale
```Java
// inside class MyClass
public void updateUserInfo(String name, int age) {
    // ... method logic ...
}
```
the riprsentaion  of this code in smali would be

```Smali
.method public updateUserInfo(Ljava/lang/String;I)V
    .locals 2
    .param p1, "name"    # Ljava/lang/String;
    .param p2, "age"    # I

    # ... method logic starts here ...
.end method
```

"name" is just a debuging metha data that we use to help us knwo what data the parameter is holding;
