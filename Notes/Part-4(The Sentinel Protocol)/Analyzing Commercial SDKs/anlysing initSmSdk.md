so today we will be tracking the main logic of this methode in this class one line at a time registering every need to know here.

# the internals of the initSmSdk
so an object of SmAntiFraud$SmOption; is created, for easynes lets call this object. format
format = new SmAntiFraud$SmOption();
now the follwoign things have been called on this object.
format..setAppId(chat);
format.setOrgnization(2Y4guzPj2WqH0cMhLXlK)
fomrat.setPublickKey("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")
format.setArea("xjp")
fomat.setUsingHttps(1(true))

now that is it with this fomrat object. now anothere imporat thign happens here, teh sdk and the app uses
a call back to communicate. now the sdk has defined an intephase that any calss should pass to it if they
ever want to sue the sdk and that is 
`Lcom/ishumei/smantifraud/SmAntiFraud$IServerSmidCallback;` now for the CommonApp class perpouse the class
that implements this is called `CommonApp$initSmSdk$1`.

so what happend is that tehre is a staci methode in the class `com/ishumei/smantifraud/SmAntiFraud
` named `registerServerIdCallback()` now what we did is  we passed this calsses implmentation of the interphase
in to this methode.

then to the las part is we call the static methode `creat(context,SmAntiFraud$SmOption)` is called.
but we passed the contex of the app from the getApplication(). 

that is it for this methode now lets clarffiyt the high tartget methdes and class.
so for me the call back is the biggest importance here as it is how the app communicated wiht the sdk.
so here are the things that we will see one step at a time.
1. the first intersset should be seeing the calss that implemntats  interphase that is `CommonApp$initSmSdk$1`. we dont need to see the interphase unless it has defulat methode which i doubt it woudl have so seeing this class and
the methodes it will have is our priotiy
2. then we will go and see how the actaull callback methode `registerServerIdCallback()` works and what methdoe it calles on `CommonApp$initSmSdk$1`

## the birdeyeview anlysis of the `CommonApp$initSmSdk$1` and teh registor methode

now my first assuption was that those strrick cheks woudl be encoded in to the implmentation but when i watn there there is only stuff like onErro(I) thigns like that and concreat implmnetation to it. but then i assumed
well if it is not the case then the registor methode would have to do the complex chekcs and then excute those interfase methodes. but when i went in it didnt do that what happend is. this methdoe is foound 
inside the class `SmAntiFraud.smali` now this class hase a static field that is `l111l11111lIl:Lcom/ishumei/smantifraud/SmAntiFraud$IServerSmidCallback;` where it will store the call back. now the registor methode only 
took p0 the first parameter of it since it is  a static methode and then put this callback frrom the CommonApp in this field. now this calss is feild with a lot of methode that oprate on this callBack field.
but here is the thing. this is the only methode of this 2000 line long class that is being called outside this packege. but wait creat() is also called in CommonApp and it passes the appcontext and the format object.
now this is the last place were the logic could lie since we have set the static feild once using our regisotre the methodes that creat() coudl call insed coudl probably use configration+appcontext+the callback;
to do all the complex checks.if we go in to this methode and foudn no call to all the othere class in ithe isHumisdk it wold mean this sdk is not used at all by teh app and is probably there as scare tatctic.

## looking inside the creat methode
as i suspect the creat methode amounts to 40% the line lentgh of the entire class and it calles all the sofsitacted and obsfcated methdoes so our main aim is to oundersadn this methode and prepare how we woudl hook it. and 
how its return types are dsined to influnace the app.

but fits lets go one step back and anlyize the concreat implimentaio of the interphase we had.

but beforre that lets talk about somhing that would be a complex situtaiton for the project. so look we have a centralised class the common app, and we have the cnetrlises call back object but i am suspecting that
the methode inside the ishumi probably will do calles direclty in to the apps class with out the callback and othere bridges that the app provides now in this senario that would be super ticky becouse there willbe many
branch outs and things will be super dirty as trakcin will be hard and lets call this "leaky abstraction".
now that woudl mean 3 cases for anlyzing this enitre condtion.
1,Thee wont be no leacky abstraction calles the call back is the way for the sdk to talk
2,there will be a leacky abstraction but for the sake of debaging the callse made woudl be to ffew class taht are handlable
3, the devlopers on perpouse would make use chace deaden leacky calles, or there app is a huge spagatie code of leacky calls

now gihdra is not worrkign well for ourr dex files but we will use powershell to go though the smali fieles that we have at our hand.
1. our shell need to be absolutly inside the entire ishumi packege. the search will be done from this.
2. now what we need to do is see if there is a call that is happening to outside the ishumi package.
3. so we should exlude any thign that macches the patern of `Lcom/ishumei` when we recurse though all the smali files inside ishumit packege. this avoids the calles that happend betwenn those ishumi packge class. so we can fcouce on the ouside methodes
4. now our target is to find thign like Lcom/somthing/somthign/...
5. now one case is an object of those class is created and then methode are called on it we need those
6. the secodn case is a static call to the outer static methode coudl be made so we need those to.
<<<<<<<makign it clean>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
7. now look all those methode will be reciving many outclass object passed possibel from the call back so they wont possiblley do invoke-static <init> on an oready created object so we shouldl safly exclud those
type of patters the L/somthign/somthing... shoudl be pressied by invoke static in that line or invoke-virtual shoudl be there. this avoid all the boiler late code to stay there
8. then if the outcome is to big we woudl use an AI to anlyize and clean it prepare it for anlysis.

so here is the script you dont need to memorize it that is what is for. but it does what we need it to do
```powershell
# === CONFIGURATION ===
# Root folder containing smali files for the com/ishumei package "C:\path\to\smali\com\ishumei"
$rootFolder = "C:\RE\poppo-RE\poppo\smali_classes4\com\ishumei" 

# Output file for results
$outputFile = "C:\RE\rep"

# Clean output file if it exists
if (Test-Path $outputFile) {
    Clear-Content $outputFile
}

# === CORE LOGIC ===
Write-Output "Scanning smali files under: $rootFolder ..."
Get-ChildItem -Path $rootFolder -Recurse -Filter "*.smali" | ForEach-Object {
    $filePath = $_.FullName
    $lineNumber = 0

    # Read file line-by-line
    Get-Content $filePath | ForEach-Object {
        $line = $_.Trim()
        $lineNumber++

        # ---------- RULE 1: Only process invoke-static or invoke-direct ----------
        # This automatically excludes invoke-virtual and other opcodes
        if ($line -notmatch '^\s*invoke-(static|direct)') { return }

        # ---------- RULE 2: Extract the target class ----------
        # Smali syntax:
        # invoke-static {v0, v1}, Lcom/example/ClassName;->methodName(...)
        #
        # This regex captures the class right after the comma:
        # Group 1 = Lcom/example/ClassName
        if ($line -match '^\s*\S+\s+\{[^}]*\},\s+(L[^;]+);') {
            $targetClass = $matches[1]

            # ---------- RULE 3: Skip if target class is inside ishumei package ----------
            if ($targetClass -like 'Lcom/ishumei*') { return }

            # ---------- RULE 4: Valid external call found ----------
            # Format the result cleanly
            $formattedOutput = "[{0}:{1}] {2}" -f $filePath, $lineNumber, $line

            # Write to screen and save to file
            Write-Output $formattedOutput
            Add-Content -Path $outputFile -Value $formattedOutput
        }
    }
}

Write-Output "Scan complete! Results saved to: $outputFile"
```

ok so bassed on the result we can say that there is not leaky reffernce that is goign on and the sdk talks to the app through the call back this woudl mean, the easy to hook an undersand implimentation of the intephase
is our target, so we shoudl anlyize it and see what happens. now the thing is from the bird eye view anlyssi that i gave it there are 2 methdoe onEror and onSuceses() so i dont know where the scroe bassed report woudl fall in all thiss
but i thinkg that i how the app know what to do. adn we will tyr to make sure that it will be always the cae that onsucces() is runned.
my hypotsis i that the complext logic in the smantiantifruad class will be bassed on the score levles and those score level will be handedl and reasend inside this class methodes but the finall case will be there will be
a methode that  will call the implimnatoin on this methode bassed on the complext logic it passed it will eithere call onEror on onSuces. so we shoudl understand this callback object first.
